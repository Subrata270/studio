## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft lavender (#E6E6FA), promoting trust and innovation.
- Background color: Pale grey (#F5F5F5) providing a neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Dusty rose (#D8BFD8) to highlight important actions and notifications.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for a modern, machined, objective, neutral look.
- Use a set of minimalist icons to represent subscription actions and status, with color-coding for clarity (green for active, yellow for pending, red for expiring).

- Subtle transitions and animations for form submissions, approvals, and payments to enhance user experience.
